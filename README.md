# CST8219Assignment0
Assignment 0 for C++ 

Purpose: You are to write the code in Visual Studio 2019for a simple C language console applicationthat holdsthe dataof ananimationapplication (there is no actual animation graphics in the assignment)using a linked listin dynamic memory.  This will give you an opportunity to review material that has already been taught in an earlier C course and get up to speed for programmingthat is used in thiscourse.In the lab you will be shown how to set up a Visual Studio 2019project and what the application looks like when it’s running. The start of the code is shown on the next page; it is also on Brightspacein atext file that you can copy and paste.Because I will use this code to mark the assignment youmustnotmodify it(not a single character changed): no code added or removed,no new global variables, no new functions, no macros, no definesand no statics. Your task is to implement(after the main() function),using C,onlythe functions that are declaredat the top of the ass0.c file and not add any new ones. All your code is in thefile ass0.c.The Animation is a series of Frameobjectsheld in a single linked list (forward list) in dynamic (heap) memory.This memory model will be adapted to a C++ template in a later assignment. When the application is running you can:addanew Frameto start of the AnimationFrame listdelete the lastFramein the listedit a selectedFrame to change the frame namereportthe Animation to show the list of Frame detailsquit.An example of the output of the running application is given at the end. Yours mustwork identically and produce identical output.Note the following:the file you submit must be named ass0.c,dynamic memory management is done with malloc()and free(),there is never any excess dynamic memory allocated-only allocate exactly what is neededfor each string entered by the useryou can only use functions like strlen() and strcpy() etc. from the standard C library to handle stringsof null terminated char,when the application terminates itreleasesalldynamically allocated memoryso it does not have a resource leak (or you lose 30%).See the Marking Sheet for how you can lose marks, but you willloseat least60% if: 
1. you change the supplied codein any way at all -no code added (except header includes) or removed, no macros,no defines,no staticsand no additional global functionsor variables, 
2. it fails to build in Visual Studio 2019
3. It crashes in normal operation(such as reportingan empty listetc.),
4. it doesn’t producethe example output.
